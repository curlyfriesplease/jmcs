# The Jon Mulhern conversation simulator

This app is simply a means of me first learning JS & react, and experimenting with various HTML, CSS, components etc.

It is a completely ridiculous concept in which various questions that have come up in the past, at the pub, are shown at random through a brash and ostentatious app.

It will show random conversation starters when the face button is pressed.

The long term intention for the app is that increasingly flamboyant page elements will be added, until it is so over the top that it's hard to look at.
